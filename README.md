# Rhythm Game Option Simulator

A web-based tool that simulates rhythm game visual options such as note speed, sudden, and hidden effects.  
This project is intended to help rhythm game players preview how different option values affect the playfield, especially when switching devices or display environments (e.g., different monitor sizes).
